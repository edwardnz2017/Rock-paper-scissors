This is my first attempt at creating a simple game using Javascript. This is Rock, Paper, Scissors.

For the index.html version ,use the play() function in the console to run the game 5 times and find the majority winner.

The betterVersion.html has been added in which I created a simple UI so that users can play it in the browser easily.
